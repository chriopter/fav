# fav

Save your favorite commands once. Run them with tab completion forever.

Remember that Docker command with all the formatting flags? Or that Git log with the perfect options? Save them with `fav` and never type them again. Just press TAB and go.

```bash
# Add command as fav:
fav add docker ps -a --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}'

# After: just three letters + TAB ðŸš€
fav dock<TAB>
```

Your commands sync between all your Macs automatically via iCloud Drive.

## Install

```bash
brew install chriopter/fav/fav
fav setup # To setup autocompletion 
```

## Use

```bash
# Save a command
fav add "docker ps -a --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'"

# Show all Favs with Index
fav

# Delete a fav by Index
fav remove 1

# Type and TAB to complete
fav doc<TAB>
# â†’ fav "docker ps -a --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'"

# Press ENTER to run
```

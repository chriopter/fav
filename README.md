# fav

Save your favorite commands and run them with a single word. No more typing long commands over and over.

## What it does

`fav` remembers your commonly used commands so you can run them instantly:

```bash
# Instead of typing this every time...
docker ps -a --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}'

# Just type:
fav docker
```

âœ¨ **Features**
- Save any command with `fav add`
- Run commands with tab completion
- Commands sync between your Macs via iCloud
- No configuration files to edit

## Installation

```bash
# Install with Homebrew

```

That's it! You're ready to go.
